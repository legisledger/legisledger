## Origin Story

This project emerged during the 2025 government shutdown when I (Damon Regan) had unexpected time to work on an idea I'd been developing for years: infrastructure that operationalizes Jonathan Rauch's (2021) "Constitution of Knowledge" through structured Bayesian reasoning.

The shutdown created a pause that allowed focused work on foundational architecture before the demands of normal work resume.
