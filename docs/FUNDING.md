# Funding Legis Ledger: Guide for Funders

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-01-25

---

## Mission

To build federated knowledge infrastructure that enables **cooperation through structured disagreement** - where institutions share expertise with transparent confidence, provenance, and Bayesian updating.

---

## Why Fund This?

### The Problem

**Current state:** Citizens can't reliably access expert knowledge:
- Wikipedia requires consensus (fails for contested facts)
- Google search prioritizes SEO over expertise
- AI chatbots hallucinate or cite sources without confidence levels
- Government guidance is siloed and hard to find
- Scientific knowledge lacks provenance transparency

**Cost to society:** Millions of citizens make decisions with incomplete, biased, or false information.

### Our Solution

**Federated knowledge infrastructure** where:
- Institutions publish expert opinions with quantified confidence
- Multiple viewpoints preserved (structured pluralism)
- Real-world outcomes validate claims (Bayesian updates)
- Users see provenance ("who says this, what are their biases?")
- No central authority controls truth (capture-resistant architecture)

### Impact

**For democracy:** Informed citizens making evidence-based decisions  
**For science:** Replication tracking and transparent uncertainty  
**For policy:** Honest assessments that update with evidence  
**For institutions:** Reduced support burden, increased trust  

---

## What We're Building

- Evidence grading system (A+ meta-analyses → C preliminary)
- Industry funding disclosure
- Transparent Bayesian reasoning path

**📋 Next 12 Months:**
- Climate change test case (canonical scientific knowledge, 0.999 confidence)
- UBI test case (contested policy domain, 0.65-0.75 confidence)
- Institution submission API (DGAC, NIH, DOT can publish directly)
- Multi-institution disagreement examples
- Smart contract governance prototype
- 20 participating institutions

## Financial Model

### Path to Sustainability

We aim for **financial self-sustainability by Year 4** through a multi-sided market model:

| Year | Grants | Commercial Revenue | Total | Status |
|------|--------|-------------------|-------|--------|
| **Year 1** | $500k | $10k | $510k | Seeking funding |
| **Year 2** | $300k | $100k | $400k | Projected |
| **Year 3** | $100k | $370k | $470k | Projected |
| **Year 4** | $0 | $560k | $560k | Self-sustaining |

### Revenue Streams (Mature State)

| Source | Who Pays | Why | Target (Year 3) |
|--------|----------|-----|-----------------|
| **API Fees** | Commercial users (travel sites, health apps) | Customer acquisition at $0.01-0.05/query | $150k |
| **Sponsorships** | Corporations, foundations | Visibility + mission alignment | $150k |
| **Data Access** | Researchers, analytics firms | Aggregate analytics (no PII) | $30k |
| **Training** | Institutions | "How to publish knowledge claims" workshops | $40k |
| **Total** | | | **$370k** |

### Cost Structure (Year 3)

| Category | Amount | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Engineering** | $400k | 2-3 FTE developers |
| **Infrastructure** | $100k | Hosting, tools, cryptographic systems |
| **Operations** | $140k | Admin, legal, accounting |
| **Marketing** | $100k | Institutional outreach, documentation |
| **Total** | **$740k** | |

**Gap in Year 3:** $370k revenue - $740k costs = **-$370k**

**Path forward:** 
- Option A: Higher commercial adoption (realistic with 50 institutional partners)
- Option B: Continued partial grant support (transitional funding)
- Option C: Lower costs through automation and open-source contributions

**We're being transparent:** Full sustainability takes 4-5 years, not 3. Year 3 still needs $100-200k in grant support.

## Governance Safeguards: Why Funding ≠ Control

### The Capture Problem

**Traditional model:** Funders → influence governance → capture infrastructure  
**Why it fails:** Compromises mission, institutions leave, network dies

### Our Structural Solution

We make capture **mathematically impossible** through architecture:

**1. Revenue Diversity (Enforced by Charter)**
- No single funder may exceed 20% of annual budget
- Enforced by non-profit bylaws, not discretion
- Board members must disclose all funding relationships

**2. Open Source + Fork Rights**
- All code: Apache 2.0 license
- All data: CC-BY or CC0
- Anyone can fork if original captured
- Federation protocol ensures interoperability

**3. Decentralized Identity**
- Institutions control their own DIDs
- Infrastructure can't censor content
- Can't force updates to claims
- No coercive power

**4. Transparent Finances**
- All transactions >$10k published within 30 days
- Quarterly financial reports (public)
- Annual independent audit (required)
- GitHub repository for all governance decisions

**5. Board Structure**
- 7 seats: 3 institutional, 2 technical, 2 domain experts
- No "funder seats" (funding doesn't buy governance control)
- Simple majority for operations, 2/3 for charter amendments
- Dissolution requires unanimous vote

### What Funders Get

**Impact metrics:**
- Institutions participating (target: 50 by Year 2)
- Knowledge abstracts published (target: 500 by Year 2)
- User accesses (target: 1M by Year 2)
- Real-world outcomes tracked (target: 10,000 by Year 2)
- Bayesian updates performed (target: 100 by Year 2)

**Recognition:**
- Named as supporter in README and website
- Quarterly impact reports
- Invitation to semi-annual demos
- Co-branded case studies (if desired)

**Tax benefits:**
- 501(c)(3) donations are tax-deductible

**What funders DON'T get:**
- ❌ Governance control
- ❌ Content approval
- ❌ Veto rights
- ❌ Board seats (unless earned through participation)

- **We:** Open source, explicit biases, Bayesian confidence

### Vs. Prediction Markets
- **They:** Financial incentives, limited domains
- **We:** Institutional expertise, all domains, non-financial

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Institutional Adoption
**Risk:** Institutions don't participate  
**Mitigation:** Value propositions by type, starting with easy domains (passenger rights, well-established science)  
**Status:** 2 MVPs complete show value

### Risk 2: Financial Sustainability
**Risk:** Revenue doesn't materialize  
**Mitigation:** Multiple revenue streams, starting with proven commercial use cases (travel industry), open-source fallback  
**Status:** API pricing validated with early partners

### Risk 3: Governance Capture
**Risk:** Funders or admins take control  
**Mitigation:** Structural impossibility through architecture (see Governance Safeguards)  
**Status:** Bylaws drafted, fork rights guaranteed

### Risk 4: Quality Control
**Risk:** Bad actors publish misinformation  
**Mitigation:** Tiered visibility based on track record, Bayesian updates expose miscalibration  
**Status:** Quality tier system designed and tested

### Risk 5: Technical Complexity
**Risk:** Bayesian reasoning too complex for users  
**Mitigation:** Excellent UX, "explained like I'm 5" content, progressive disclosure  
**Status:** Creatine example shows clear explanation works
