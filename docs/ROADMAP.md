**Raise seed if:**
- ✅ 20+ abstracts completed
- ✅ 10k+ website visitors
- ✅ Strong customer interest (50+ inbound leads)
- ✅ Hatch Act clearance obtained

**Bootstrap longer if:**
- ⚠️ Customer interest weak (<10 inbound leads)

**Raise Series A if:**
- ✅ 4/6 pilots converted (67%+ conversion)
- ✅ $200k+ ARR from 10+ customers
- ✅ 80%+ retention
- ✅ Clear expansion signals

**Iterate model if:**
- ⚠️ <50% pilot conversion (pricing too high? value unclear?)
- ⚠️ <70% retention (product not sticky)
- ⚠️ Sales cycle >120 days (too long)

### Decision Point 3 (Month 18): Series A or Profitability?

**Raise Series A if:**

- ✅ 20+ customers
- ✅ 80%+ retention
- ✅ Path to $5M ARR visible

**Stay profitable if:**
- ✅ $500k ARR = break-even
- ⚠️ Comfortable with slower growth
- ⚠️ Want to maintain control (no VCs)

### Decision Point 4 (Month 36): Series B, Profitability, or Exit?

**Series B if:**
- ✅ $5M+ ARR
- ✅ 100+ customers
- ✅ Clear path to $50M ARR
- ✅ Want IPO trajectory

**Profitability path if:**
- ✅ $5M ARR = profitable
- ✅ Prefer sustainable growth

## Risk Matrix & Contingencies

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Institutions don't adopt** | Medium | High | Build corpus first (Archive.org model) | Focus on B2B customers, institutional partnerships later |
| **Methodology challenged** | Low | High | Hire Bayesian professor, peer review | Refine approach, publish methodology papers |
| **Competition from Big Tech** | Medium | Medium | Open source + fork rights = moat | Pivot to infrastructure play (protocol, not product) |
| **Revenue model doesn't work** | Medium | High | Multi-sided market (not dependent on one segment) | Pivot to different customer segment or pricing |
| **Hatch Act blocks transition** | Low | High | Clearance in progress, consulting legal | Delay full-time transition, bootstrap longer |
| **Team scaling challenges** | High | Medium | Hire experienced VP Sales, VP Product | Founders stay small, outsource growth |

**Key Insight for Investors:**
> "We're not waiting for institutions to adopt federated infrastructure. We're building the corpus first (Archive.org model), proving value to customers, then institutional partnerships emerge naturally. This de-risks the biggest assumption."
