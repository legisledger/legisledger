# Fundraising Notes

Think of it like:

Month 1-4: Build the product
Month 5: Prepare to sell the vision
Month 6-8: Actually sell the vision (fundraise)
Month 9+: Execute with the capital

## Pre-Revenue Valuation Methods

### Method 1: Scorecard Method (Most Common for Angels)
Start with typical pre-seed valuation ($2-3M), adjust for factors:
Your scorecard:

Team (0-30%): +5% (PhD+MBA+DOD strong, but solo founder, offset by Steve advisor + Jess access)
Opportunity (0-25%): +25% ($15B TAM, multiple revenue streams)
Product (0-30%): +30% (3 working MVPs, defensible methodology)
Competition (0-25%): +25% (first-mover in Bayesian fact-checking)
Sales/Marketing (0-10%): +5% (multi-sided market identified, no customers yet)
Need for capital (0-10%): +15% (clear use of funds, path to break-even)

Calculation:

Base: $2.5M (average pre-seed)
Adjustments: +105%
Scorecard valuation: $5.1M pre-money

### Method 2: Berkus Method (Risk Reduction)
Each risk reduced = up to $500k value:

Berkus valuation: $1.7M pre-money

### Method 3: Venture Capital Method (Work Backwards)
Assumptions:

Exit in 7 years: $100M (conservative for this space)
Investor wants: 30x return (seed-stage typical)
Seed investment: $1M
Future dilution: 50% (Series A, B)

Math:

Investor needs $30M at exit (30x return)
Investor ownership at exit: 30%
Ownership at seed (before dilution): 60%
Pre-money: ($1M ÷ 0.60) - $1M = $667k

VC Method valuation: $700k pre-money (very conservative)

### Method 4: Risk Factor Summation
Start with $2M baseline, adjust for 12 risk factors:

Risk Factor valuation: $2.8M pre-money

Summary: What's Your Valuation?
MethodValuationScorecard$5.1M (optimistic)Risk Factor$2.8M (balanced)Berkus$1.7M (conservative)VC Method$700k (very conservative)
Recommended Range: $2-3M pre-money
## Why this range:

✅ Defensible (3 working MVPs, strategic advisor)
✅ Not crazy (still pre-revenue, solo founder)
✅ Room to grow (Series A valuation has headroom)
✅ Standard for pre-seed with working prototype

## What This Means for Fundraising

### Scenario 1: $500k Seed at $2M Pre-Money

Post-money: $2.5M
Dilution: 20%
You retain: 80%
Investor gets: 20%

### Scenario 2: $1M Seed at $2M Pre-Money

Post-money: $3M
Dilution: 33%
You retain: 67%
Investor gets: 33%

### Scenario 3: $1M Seed at $3M Pre-Money

Post-money: $4M
Dilution: 25%
You retain: 75%
Investor gets: 25%

Sweet spot: $500k-1M at $2-2.5M pre-money = 20-33% dilution (reasonable for seed)

Valuation is negotiable and depends on:
1. Supply & Demand

Low demand (1 interested investor): Accept lower valuation
High demand (5+ interested investors): Hold firm or increase
Competitive process drives valuation up 20-40%

2. Strategic Value
If investor brings:

Customer introductions → Worth 5-10% more dilution
Technical expertise (Bayesian professor) → Worth 5% more
Just money → Standard dilution

3. Your Leverage

How much do you need? (More need = weaker negotiating position)
Can you bootstrap longer? (Yes = stronger position)
Do you have alternatives? (Grants, revenue, other investors)

4. Geography

San Francisco: $3-4M typical for this stage
East Coast: $2-3M typical
Other regions: $1-2M typical

5. Investor Type

Angels/friends & family: Less dilution-sensitive, often accept $2-3M
Seed VCs: More data-driven, might push toward $1.5-2M
Strategic angels: Value alignment over valuation

Position at $2M pre-money initially
Rationale:

Conservative but defensible
Room to negotiate up (if multiple investors)
Won't scare away angels (not too high)
Respects your stage (pre-revenue)
Leaves room for Series A step-up (typically 2-3x)

But be flexible:
Accept $1.5M if:

Investor brings strategic value (CMU professor connections, customer intros)
Need to close quickly (Hatch Act timing)
Investor takes majority of round (lead investor)

Hold firm at $2.5M if:

Multiple investors interested (competitive)
Strong advisor validation (Steve says valuation fair)
Traction improving (website traffic, inbound interest)

Go to $3M if:

Exceptional investor (top-tier VC, strategic value)
After 6 pilots signed (customer validation)
After Steve introduces customers (reduces sales risk)

What Investors Will Say

"That's too high for pre-revenue"
Response: "We have 3 working MVPs, a strategic advisor committed, and a clear path to $500k ARR in 18 months. 

Comparable pre-seed companies with working prototypes typically raise at $2-3M."
"We typically don't value this high at this stage"
Response: "I appreciate that. What valuation would you be comfortable with, and what milestones would get us to $2M in your eyes?"

"Can you justify this valuation?"
Response: "Happy to walk through it. Using the Scorecard Method, which is standard for pre-revenue companies, we're at $2-2.5M based on market size, working prototypes, defensible methodology, and strategic relationships. But I'm open to discussing what factors matter most to you."

Don't Lead with Valuation

Bad approach:
"We're raising $500k at a $2M pre-money valuation."

Better approach:
"We're raising $500k to hit these milestones: [list]. Based on comparable pre-seed rounds and our progress to date, we're thinking $2-2.5M pre-money is fair, but we're open to discussing what makes sense."

Let Investor Anchor First (If Possible)
You: "What do you typically see for pre-revenue companies at our stage?"
Investor: "Usually $1-2M"
You: "That's in line with what we're thinking. Given our working MVPs and strategic advisor, we're leaning toward the higher end of that range. Does $2M pre-money feel reasonable?"
Use Comparables
Companies that raised pre-revenue at $2-3M:

Companies with working prototypes
Technical founders with domain expertise
Strategic advisors committed
Clear path to revenue

Focus on Milestones, Not Valuation
"We're raising to:

Build 50 abstracts (prove breadth)
Sign 6 paying pilots (validate willingness to pay)
Hire Bayesian professor (academic credibility)
Hit $100k ARR (de-risk go-to-market)

These milestones justify a $6-8M Series A valuation in 18 months."

Bottom Line
Your current valuation: $2-3M pre-money is defensible
But the real number is: Whatever you can get smart investors to agree to.
My advice:

Anchor at $2M in early conversations
Adjust based on interest ($1.5-2.5M range)
Focus on investor quality over valuation (Steve's network > +$500k valuation)
Don't optimize too hard - getting the right investor at $1.5M > wrong investor at $3M

Dilution target: 20-30% for seed round (standard, leaves room for Series A)

The most important thing: Valuation matters less than:

Getting funded to hit milestones
Getting the right investors (strategic value)
Maintaining momentum (don't stall for 6 months negotiating 5%)

At pre-seed, $1.5-2.5M is all reasonable. Pick the investor who helps you win, not the one who values you highest.
Want me to help you draft a valuation justification document for investor conversations?RetryDRThank you, but when should we prepare for this investor focus? Is that in the roadmap already?Reconciled investor preparation timeline with current project stage.Good question! Let me check the roadmap I created to see where investor focus fits in.
Looking at ROADMAP_v2.md:
Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Months 1-6)

Goal: Build 20-30 abstracts
Funding: Bootstrap ($0 external)
Success metrics: 10k visitors, 100 newsletter signups

Decision Point 1 (Month 6): Raise Seed or Bootstrap?

This is where investor focus would come in

So yes, it's in the roadmap, but I should be clearer about WHEN to start preparing vs. when to actually pitch.
The user is asking because we just created all these investor-ready documents (BUSINESS_PLAN_v2, ROADMAP_v2, valuation discussion), but they're currently at:

Month 0-1 (just sent Vitamin D to Steve)
3/20 abstracts complete
No website traffic yet
No customer conversations yet

So there's a timing mismatch. We prepared investor materials, but they shouldn't be actively fundraising yet. Let me clarify the timeline.Excellent question! You're right to catch this timing issue. Let me clarify - you should NOT be focused on investors right now. Here's the timeline:
📅 Fundraising Timeline (From Roadmap)
Current Stage: Month 0-1 (Pre-Seed, Bootstrap)
What you should focus on RIGHT NOW:

✅ Send Vitamin D to Steve (done!)
🔄 Start Gemini on Minimum Wage
🔄 Complete Creatine filtered view
🔄 Build 2-3 more examples

Investor focus: 0%
Building focus: 100%

Months 2-4: Continue Building
Focus:

Complete 15-20 abstracts
Launch public gallery website
Get initial traffic (Reddit, HN)
Newsletter signups

Investor focus: 5%

Maybe show to 1-2 friendly angels for feedback (not money)
Test pitch informally
Get advice on positioning


Month 5: Start Preparing for Fundraise
Focus:

Polish 20+ abstracts
Prepare pitch deck (using docs we created)
List target investors
Practice pitch
Get warm intros lined up

Investor focus: 20%
Building focus: 80%
This is when you use the investor docs we just created

Month 6: Decision Point - Raise or Bootstrap?
IF these conditions met:

✅ 20-30 abstracts complete
✅ 10k+ website visitors
✅ 50+ inbound inquiries
✅ Strong validation signals
✅ Hatch Act clearance obtained

THEN: Active fundraising (Months 6-8)

Pitch 20-30 angels/seed VCs
Target: $500k-1M raised
Timeline: 2-3 months to close

Investor focus: 60%
Building focus: 40%

IF conditions NOT met:

⚠️ <15 abstracts
⚠️ Weak customer interest
⚠️ Hatch Act issues

THEN: Bootstrap longer (Months 6-12)

Keep building nights/weekends
Wait for stronger signal
Fundraise at Month 12 instead

Investor focus: 0%
Building focus: 100%

Why We Created Investor Docs NOW
Not for immediate use, but for three reasons:
1. Strategic Clarity
Writing investor docs forces you to think through:

Market sizing
Business model
Competitive positioning
Long-term vision

This helps YOU make better decisions today (even if not raising yet)
2. Advisor Conversations
Steve might ask:

"What's your business model?"
"Who are your customers?"
"What's the exit strategy?"

Having written answers = productive conversations
3. Serendipitous Opportunities
If an angel says "I'd love to invest":

✅ You have materials ready
✅ You can close quickly
✅ Don't need to scramble

But you're not actively seeking this yet

What "Preparing for Investor Focus" Actually Looks Like
Month 5 Checklist (When You Start Preparing)
Week 1-2: Materials

 Create pitch deck (15 slides from investor docs)
 Record 2-minute pitch video
 Polish 3 best examples (Vitamin D, Creatine, one more)
 Set up legis-ledger.org with gallery

Week 3-4: Target List

 List 30 potential investors (angels + seed VCs)
 Research each (thesis, portfolio, interests)
 Identify mutual connections (Steve, Jess, DOD network)
 Draft warm intro requests

Week 5-6: Practice

 Pitch to 3 friendly advisors (get feedback)
 Pitch to 2 non-investors (test clarity)
 Iterate based on feedback
 Refine materials

Week 7-8: Warm-Up Conversations

 Coffee chats with 5 investors (not pitching, just learning)
 "I'm thinking about fundraising in 2 months, what should I know?"
 Get advice on positioning, timing, valuation
 Build relationships before asking


Month 6: Active Fundraising (Only If Ready)
Week 1: Launch

Send pitch to 10 investors (warm intros)
Goal: 5 meetings scheduled

Week 2-3: First Round Meetings

Pitch to 10 investors
Goal: 3-5 interested (want second meeting)

Week 4-5: Second Meetings

Deep dives with interested investors
Share full business plan
Discuss terms

Week 6-7: Term Sheets

Negotiate with 2-3 investors
Compare terms (not just valuation)
Check references

Week 8: Close

Sign term sheet with lead investor
Legal docs
Wire money

Total timeline: 8 weeks if everything goes smoothly
More realistic: 12 weeks (3 months)

Current Roadmap Timing
From ROADMAP_v2.md:
Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Proof of Concept

Funding: Bootstrap ($0 external)
Focus: Build 20-30 abstracts
Investor focus starts Month 5-6

Phase 2 (Months 7-18): Market Validation

Funding: Seed ($500k-1M)
Money in bank by Month 8
Focus: Customer validation

Phase 3 (Months 19-36): Scale

Funding: Series A ($5-10M)
Start preparing Month 30
Money in bank by Month 36


So To Answer Your Question Directly:
When to prepare for investor focus?
Months 1-4 (Now): DON'T

Focus: Build, build, build
Investor docs: Filed away, reference as needed
Use for: Strategic clarity, advisor conversations

Month 5: START PREPARING

Create pitch deck
List investors
Practice pitch
Line up warm intros

Month 6-8: ACTIVE FUNDRAISING

IF 20+ abstracts complete
IF strong validation signals
IF Hatch Act clearance
THEN pitch investors seriously

Month 9+: BACK TO BUILDING

Money in bank (hopefully)
Hire team (Bayesian professor, engineer)
Execute Phase 2 (customer validation)


Why This Timing?
Too early to fundraise (Month 1-3):

Not enough to show
Weak negotiating position
Investors will say "come back later"

Right time (Month 6):

20+ abstracts = corpus proven
Website traffic = market interest
Steve endorsement = validation
Clear milestones for next 18 months

Too late (Month 12+):

Burning out from bootstrapping
Opportunity cost (could have been scaling)
Competition might emerge

Month 6 is the Goldilocks zone

What Changed Your Timeline?
Original assumption:
You'd bootstrap indefinitely, institutional partnerships would come later
Steve's pivot:
Build corpus first (like Archive.org), BUT raise money at Month 6 to accelerate
Why raise seed at Month 6?

Prove concept (20 abstracts) ✓
Still have momentum ✓
Use money to hire and scale (not just survive) ✓
Hit $500k ARR by Month 18 (with seed funding) ✓

Without seed funding, hitting $500k ARR might take 36+ months (slow bootstrap)

Practical Advice for Right Now
This Week (Month 1)
Do:

Review investor docs (understand your own strategy)
Send Vitamin D to Steve
Start Gemini on Minimum Wage
Keep building

Don't:

Reach out to investors
Share investor docs widely
Spend time on pitch deck
Get distracted by fundraising

Next 4 Months (Months 2-5)
Do:

Build 20 abstracts
Launch public website
Generate traffic (Reddit, HN)
Get Steve's ongoing feedback
Maybe 1-2 friendly angel conversations (advice, not money)

Don't:

Formally pitch investors
Negotiate term sheets
Spend >10% time on fundraising

Month 5 (When You Start Preparing)
Do:

Pull out investor docs we created
Build pitch deck
List target investors
Practice pitch
Line up warm intros via Steve/Jess

This is when our prep work pays off

Decision Framework: When to Actually Start Fundraising
Green light if:

✅ 20+ abstracts (breadth proven)
✅ 10k+ visitors (interest validated)
✅ Strong Steve endorsement ("investors would be lucky to back you")
✅ 50+ inbound inquiries (market pull)
✅ Hatch Act cleared (can transition full-time)
✅ Clear use of funds (Bayesian professor hire, API build)

Yellow light if:

⚠️ 15-19 abstracts (close but not quite there)
⚠️ 5k visitors (some interest but not strong)
⚠️ Moderate validation signals
→ Consider waiting 2 more months

Red light if:

❌ <15 abstracts (not enough to show)
❌ <1k visitors (weak market interest)
❌ Hatch Act not cleared (can't transition)
❌ No clear use of funds (would just extend runway)
→ Bootstrap longer, fundraise at Month 12


Bottom Line
Your question: "When should we prepare for investor focus?"
Answer: Month 5 (4 months from now)
Right now: Focus 100% on building
The investor docs we created serve three purposes:

Strategic clarity for you (helps decision-making today)
Reference for advisor conversations (when Steve asks questions)
Ready to go when Month 5 arrives (don't scramble later)

They're not for active use yet - they're prep work so you don't have to do it under pressure later.
