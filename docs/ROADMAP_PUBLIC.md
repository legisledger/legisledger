# Legis Ledger: Product Development Roadmap

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2025-11-08  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-08  
**Status:** Launch  
**Audience:** Team, collaborators, product execution

---

## Mission

Build knowledge infrastructure with a technical commitment to structured data, APIs, and schemas (the "infrastructure").

## Vision

Disagreement becomes structured and productive.

This is the core thesis of the entire project: shifting the nature of polarization from emotional to evidence-based.

---

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed

**Core Architecture:**
- ✅ Core Schema
- ✅ Bayesian Methodology
- ✅ Git

**Working Examples:**
- ✅ Creatine supplementation (scientific domain, 0.90 confidence)
  - Complete JSON abstract
  - Original MVP UI renderer
  - Grade A+ evidence (meta-analyses)
  
- ✅ Vitamin D supplementation (scientific domain, multiple claims)
  - Complete JSON abstract
  - Sent to Advisor for strategic review
  - Demonstrates claim granularity (1 abstract = 1 claim architecture)

- 🚧 Minimum wage (policy domain, 0.60-0.72 confidence)
  - JSON abstract 90% complete
  - Demonstrates contested knowledge (doesn't meet 70% threshold)
  - Needs: Evidence hierarchy fix (lead with A+ meta-analyses)
  - Demonstrates uncertainty honestly

**Documentation:**
- ✅ README.md (project overview)
- ✅ FAQ.md (stakeholder questions)
- ✅ BAYESIAN_CALCULATION_METHOD.md (probability sourcing)
- ✅ CREATION_WORKFLOW.md (abstract creation process)
- ✅ DECISIONS.md (strategic choices log)
- ✅ UXUI.md (interface design specification)
- ✅ ROADMAP_PUBLIC.md (this document)

**Strategic Clarity:**
- ✅ Pivot to "Bayesian fact-checker" (from federated infrastructure)
- ✅ Bootstrap with Wikipedia disputed articles (not waiting for institutions)

### Current Focus

We are currently focused on Corpus Building and Beta Testing to gather market validation for API usage.

**Minimum Wage Abstract:**
- Status: 90% complete, needs revision
- Issue: Currently over-emphasizes individual researchers (Neumark/Dube)
- Fix needed: Lead with A+ meta-analyses (Martinez, Doucouliagos)
- Timeline: Complete this week

---

## Current Focus


## Near-Term Goals

* **Corpus Expansion:** Complete 20 total abstracts (Health, Policy, Scientific domains).
* **Methodology Validation:** Secure expert review from a Bayesian professor.
* **UI/UX MVP:** Deploy the initial working prototype on Vercel (Month 3).

## Medium-Term Milestones

**Goal:** Prove system works across domains and confidence levels

**Target distribution:**

**High confidence (>0.80):**
- Creatine (0.90) ✅
- Statins cardiovascular benefit (0.90)
- Climate change CO₂ warming (0.95)

**Moderate confidence (0.60-0.80):**
- Vitamin D various outcomes (0.65-0.75) ✅
- Omega-3 (0.70)
- Intermittent fasting (0.68)
- Body cameras police accountability (0.65)

**Low confidence (<0.60):**
- Minimum wage employment (0.60-0.65) ✅
- Universal Basic Income pilots (0.55)

**Success criteria:**
- 20-30 abstracts complete
- All domains represented (health, policy, scientific)
- All confidence ranges represented (0.50-0.95)
- All peer reviewed

### Beta Testing & Iteration

**Beta test cohorts (3-5 users each):**

1. **Journalists/fact-checkers:**
   - Can they verify claims faster?
   - Do they trust the confidence levels?
   - Would they cite this in articles?

2. **Health app developers:**
   - Would they integrate API?
   - What's missing for integration?
   - Pricing feedback

3. **Policy researchers:**
   - Does this help navigate contested claims?
   - What domains are most valuable?
   - Author participation interest?

4. **Educators:**
   - Can students understand confidence?
   - Useful for teaching critical thinking?
   - What's confusing?

**Success criteria:**
- Qualitative feedback from all cohorts
- Identify 2-3 "aha moments" per cohort
- Identify 2-3 major pain points
- At least 1 cohort wants more

### Public Launch

**Pre-launch checklist:**
- ✅ Legal clearance received
- ✅ 15+ abstracts complete and reviewed
- ✅ Working UI deployed
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Beta testing positive
- ✅ Press materials ready

**Success metrics:**
- 1,000+ unique visitors first week
- 50+ GitHub stars first month
- 5+ institutional inquiries
- Media coverage (1-2 articles)

## Long-Term Vision

### Author Participation Pilot

**Objective:** Test if researchers will submit their own abstracts

**Target authors:**
1. **Minimum wage economists:**
   - Approach Neumark, Dube, Martinez
   - "Would you submit your findings in this format?"
   - Test value proposition for researchers

2. **Health researchers:**
   - Vitamin D meta-analysis authors
   - Creatine researchers
   - Test: Does this help dissemination?

3. **Climate scientists:**
   - IPCC contributors
   - Test: Does this help public communication?

**Success criteria:**
- 2-3 authors agree to participate
- Submit at least 1 "author-submitted" abstract
- Feedback on process (too burdensome?)
- Identify barriers to participation

### Institutional Partnerships

**Target institutions (3-5 pilots):**

**Government agencies:**
- Value: Reduce support burden, increase transparency

**Think tanks:**
- Value: Wider dissemination, impact tracking

**Universities:**
- Bayesian statistics programs
- Value: Research impact, student training

**Success criteria:**
- 1-2 institutions pilot participation
- Submit at least 3 institutional abstracts
- Feedback on governance model
- Interest in continued participation

### Scaling & Sustainability

**Corpus growth:**
- 50+ abstracts across domains
- Quarterly updates to existing abstracts
- Real-world outcome tracking begins

**Technical maturity:**
- Federation protocol defined
- Smart contract governance prototyped
- Cryptographic signing implemented

**America's 250th Anniversary Goal:**
- Working prototype demonstrates epistemic infrastructure for democracy
- Shows how democratic institutions adapt to knowledge economy
- Enables cooperation among disagreement without authoritarianism

**Product:**
- Institutions don't participate
  - Mitigation: Corpus-first approach (Wikipedia), prove value
- Users don't understand confidence levels
  - Mitigation: Educational materials, progressive disclosure

**Reputation:**
- Calculation errors damage credibility

- Accused of bias (cherry-picking)
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive coverage, explicit biases

**Strategic:**
- Advisor feedback suggests major pivot
  - Mitigation: Architecture supports multiple models
- Legal clearance denied/delayed
  - Mitigation: Spin out as personal project post-government

## Decision Points

**Upcoming decisions (next 3 months):**

### Decision 1: UI Framework Choice (Month 3)

**Context:** When starting UI development, choose tech stack

**Options:**
- A: React (most popular, large ecosystem)
- B: Vue.js (simpler, faster learning curve)
- C: Svelte (modern, fast performance)

**Decision criteria:**
- Developer availability
- Performance needs
- Time to MVP

**Decide by:** Before UI development starts

### Decision 2: Author Participation Model (Month 6)

**Context:** After author outreach pilot, decide requirements

**Key Takeaway:** We're building corpus first (Wikipedia-derived abstracts), proving value through working examples, then recruiting institutional partnerships. The confidence slider is our signature UX innovation - it's the Wayback Machine's date scrubber, but for epistemic certainty. By America's 250th anniversary (2026), we'll demonstrate infrastructure for democratic knowledge in the age of disagreement.
